Three neat tools for disk-drives and SD2IEC, especially with Jiffy-DOS support.

### DraCopy

Copy files from SD2IEC and vice versa. Supports copying files from or to D64 and folders.  

### Directory Browser

Useful for handling the SD2IEC. A very small and fast tool.

### File-Copier

The classical tool for copying files between real drives. A convertion from the known C64-tool.


DraCopy and Directory-Browser are very powerful using Jiffy-DOS in all devices.

make       - creates roms for the standard-cartridge (c1lo/c1hi)

make run   - launches xplus4 with attached roms

make clean - deletes roms

Useful for handling the SD2IEC

## Known issues

In some cases the File-Copiers colored texts blink after prg-start. Select the function to show the directory and after showing it, all text are normalized. 

All in all it runs stable and useful.

Have fun !
